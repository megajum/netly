Last year, 15 players, the majority from FC Barcelona, wrote identical emails to Luis Rubiales, head of the Spanish FA (RFEF), saying that due to their \u201cemotional state and as such [their] health\u201d, they were unavailable for selection to the squad. The players all published a statement that did not highlight the exact reasons as to why they were unhappy with Vilda\u2019s management, and as such this has caused more harm than good for everyone involved. Since this moment, Spain\u2019s national team, which went into Euro 2022 as one of the favourites, has suffered huge damage on all sides. Nobody has emerged as the victor in this.Full screenJenni Hermoso and Irene Paredes have both returned to the squad ahead of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.INMA FLORESDiarioASIrene and Jenni have returned to Spain: will the other players?However, over the past few months, with the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand looming, jigsaw pieces have started to move and there has been a sliver of light that has crept through the gaps: both Irene Paredes and Jenni Hermoso have returned to the squad which has seen massive overhaul given the amount of players who have declared themselves as not available. Spain have three difficult tournament opponents and will ply against Costa Rica, Zambia and Japan in the group stage.With the return of Jenni and Irene, rumours have swirled that other players may also be in negotiations with the RFEF regarding a possible return to the fray. When asked whether she was likely to make a comeback, Mapi Le\u00f3n, a firm favourite in the Barcelona fanbase, all but ruled herself out completely.Full screenSpain lost in the Euro 2022 quarter-finals to eventual champions England.MATTHEW CHILDSREUTERSMapi says she \u2018deserves\u2019 to be at the World Cup\u201cRight now I\u2019m not going to the World Cup\u201d, she said, \u201cIt makes me sad, as I deserve it and I contributed to getting the team there, but it\u2019s not a decision that you take lightly and and it\u2019s not easy. My decision is clear. Mapi Le\u00f3n has a way of living and she has values to stick to. I can\u2019t go back, there has to be changes. If they tell me and there is a plan, but I don\u2019t see changes.\u201dMapi Le\u00f3n did not open up on exactly what those changes are, whether she wants the manager gone or more simple, structural changes to the setup with the National Team. This in itself is the root of the confusion from many: it is fair to ask for changes but to do so with half of the public side of the message covered is only going to create anger and suspicion.

All of the 23 players are ready to play, to perform and give their all. It\u2019s an attractive team in terms of the style and we are creating a very cohesive group with players who are totally committed.\u201d\u201cIf we all go in the right direction and we all try our best, playing how we want to play, which are bigger than some irrelevant things, I\u2019m sure we will achieve all the objectives that we set ourselves\u201d, he said.<br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/en.as.com\/soccer\/barcelona-defender-mapi-leon-says-she-isnt-going-to-the-world-cup-and-cant-go-back-to-the-spain-team-n\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FC Barcelona defender, Mapi Le\u00f3n spoke to Catalan radio station RAC1 as part of their T\u00fa Dir\u00e1s programme, in which she opened up on whether or not the situation has changed regarding the impasse in the Spanish Women\u2019s National Team.
