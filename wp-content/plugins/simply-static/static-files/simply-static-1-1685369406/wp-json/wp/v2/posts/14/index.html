Barcelona and Napoli had LaLiga and Serie A respectively wrapped up months ago, Manchester City winning the Premier League felt inevitable as soon as Arsenal slipped up once and, for all their considerable issues, Paris Saint-Germain never really looked like surrendering their lead in Ligue 1. Thank goodness for the Bundesliga.European winners still to be decidedOf course, the identity of this season\u2019s Champions League winners is still unknown, although City are overwhelming favourites to see off Inter to win the trophy for the first time in their history. Sevilla would be guaranteed to win a seventh Europa League were they not up against European final specialist Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Roma in the final, while we mustn\u2019t forget about the Europa Conference League final, which will see West Ham take on Fiorentina.But we will forget about the Europa Conference League for now, as, unlike the Champions League and Europa League finals, it will have no bearing on which teams will feature in the 2023\/24 Champions League, which will be the last edition of the competition until a new format is introduced in 2024\/25.Which of the 32 spots are still to be decided?You know the drill. 32 teams will take part in the group stages, with 25 spots already taken. The winners of this season\u2019s Champions League automatically qualify for next year\u2019s but City and Inter have already qualified anyway. The Europa League winners, Sevilla or Roma, will take spot 26, with the six remaining teams decided by the qualifying rounds, which will take place from June to August.2023\/24 Champions League group stage qualifiers by country<br \/>\nEngland: Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United, Newcastle United<br \/>\nSpain: Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Real Sociedad<br \/>\nItaly: Napoli, Lazio, Inter, Milan<br \/>\nGermany: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Union Berlin<br \/>\nFrance: Paris Saint-Germain, Lens<br \/>\nPortugal: Benfica, Porto<br \/>\nNetherlands: Feyenoord<br \/>\nUkraine: Shakhtar Donetsk<br \/>\nAustria: FC Salzburg<br \/>\nScotland: Celtic<br \/>\n2023\/24 Champions League group stage qualifiers by potPot 12022\/23 Champions League winners2022\/23 Europa League winnersManchester City (ENG)Barcelona (ESP)Napoli (ITA)Bayern Munich (GER)Paris Saint-Germain (FRA)Benfica (POR)Pot 1 or 2Inter (ITA)Pot 1 or 3Feyenoord (NED)Pot 2Real Madrid (ESP)Manchester United (ENG)Borussia Dortmund (GER)Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (ESP)RB Leipzig (GER)Porto (POR)Arsenal (ENG)Pot 2 or 3Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR)Pot 3FC Salzburg (AUS)Milan (ITA)Lazio (ITA)Red Star Belgrade (SRB)Pot 3 or 4Real Sociedad (ESP)Celtic (SCO)Newcastle United (ENG)Four winners from Champions Path qualificationTwo winners from League Path qualificationPot 4Union Berlin (GER)Lens (FRA)Champions League pots explainedThe 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four, which will be composed of one team from each of the four pots, ensuring that all groups are roughly of the same standard. Clubs from the same country cannot be drawn to play against each other in the group stage.Several teams don\u2019t yet know which pot they are in because we don\u2019t know the winner of this year\u2019s Champions League or which teams will progress from qualification. The full pot list won\u2019t be confirmed until the qualifying rounds finish in August.Notable ins and outsWhile most of the names above are the usual runners and riders, there are one or two that stand out, such as Newcastle United, who last qualified for the Champions League group stage in 2002\/03, the same year French side Lens last featured. German side Union Berlin will be playing in the competition for the first time in their history after finishing fourth in the Bundesliga. Among the biggest names to have missed out are six-time winners Liverpool, who reached three finals in five years from 2018 to 2022, and Juventus, who suffered a 10-point deduction in Serie A and lost at home to Milan in the penultimate league game of the season, which ended their challenge.<br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/en.as.com\/soccer\/which-teams-have-qualified-for-uefa-champions-league-group-stage-for-the-202324-season-n\/\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 2022\/23 Champions League hasn\u2019t even reached its climax yet but we already have a fairly clear picture about which clubs will be in the group stages of the 2023\/24 Champions League.The European club season has almost come to an end and, if we\u2019re being brutally honest, it\u2019s been a bit of a let-down in&hellip; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/tech\/netly\/2023\/05\/29\/which-teams-have-qualified-for-uefa-champions-league-group-stage-for-the-2023-24-season\/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Which teams have qualified for UEFA Champions League group stage for the 2023\/24 season?<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.8 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\r\n<title>Which teams have qualified for UEFA Champions League group stage for the 2023\/24 season?
